            a nice outfit?</p>
        <p class="story" style="display: none;" id="choosemakeup"><em>(You think:)</em> I would feel so uncomfortable
            leaving the house without makeup... I don't want anyone to see my imperfections, and I doubt anyone would
            notice if I wore a basic outfit today. You grab the easiest and quickest thing to throw on, What do you
            grab?</p>
        <p class="story" style="display: none;" id="chooseoutfit"><em>(You think:)</em> I should definitely choose an
            outfit first. It's really important to look presentable. You go through your entire closet searching for the
            perfect outfit. Which do you choose?</p>
        <p class="story" style="display: none;" id="choosetank"><em>(You think:)</em> I guess I'll just have to throw
            this on so I'll be able to get to school on time.</p>
        <p class="story" style="display: none;" id="showfinally">You FINALLY get to school and rush to your locker. As
            you turn the corner, you bump into a guy who you've never talked to before. Before you know it, everything
            falls out of your bag, including your tampons! He glances at them as you awkwardly put them back into your
            bag. He looks concerned as he helps you pick up your stuff. "Hey are you okay? You look kind of dead. Are
            you sick?" </p>

            at you and says: "I can see your bra strap and its making me uncomfortable.. I just dont think that is
            appropriate." </p>

            things, he jokingly comments on your outfit. "What are you wearing?? Is that a Bar Mitzvah shirt? " </p>
        <p class="story" style="display: none;" id="shownotice1"><em>(You think:)</em> What does that even mean? Why was
            he criticizing your outfit and why was showing your bra strap a bad thing? </p>
        <p class="story" style="display: none;" id="shownotice">You look down at the outfit you put so much thought into
            picking. <em>(You think:)</em> Is that why he said I "looked dead"? Should I have put on makeup instead this
            morning? Would people have actually noticed that instead of this outfit?</p>
        <p class="story" style="display: none;" id="shownotice2">You look down at your shirt and wonder why it's such a
            big deal that you didn't wear your "typical" outfit today. You've seen plently of guys wearing more casual
            clothing, but why are you judged for it when you wear stuff like that?</p>
        <p class="story" style="display: none;" id="chooseclass">Embarrassed, you head towards your next class, trying
            not to let what he said affect your mood. Which class are you going to?</p>
        <p class="story" style="display: none;" id="choosegym">You run through the doors to the gymnasium and you make
            it to class just in time. You hear Coach Gerald asking the boys if any of them will help move the soccer
            goal. <em>(You think:)</em> Why did he just ask the boys? Do I not seem strong enough to help move the goal?
        </p>
        <p class="story" style="display: none;" id="choosecs">You run into your computer science class just in time.
            Everyone looks up at you. Maybe it's because you were kind of late, but it's probably because you're the
            only girl in the class. You go through the rows of desks, looking for a place to sit. </p>
        <p class="story" style="display: none;" id="nextpage">Once the goal is out of the way, Coach Gerald greets the
            class. "Today we're splitting up into two groups, soccer and yoga. When I call your name, tell me which
            group you want to join." Which do you join?</p>
        <p class="story" style="display: none;" id="choosesoccer">When he gets to your name, you tell him that you want
            to play soccer. He says to you: "Are you sure you want to play soccer with the boys? They are pretty
            aggressive!" You feel kind of annoyed. <em>(You think:)</em> Who cares? Why can't I just play soccer. How do
            you respond?</p>
        <p class="story" style="display: none;" id="chooseyoga">When he gets to your name, you tell him that you want to
            do yoga. He says to you:"Good Choice! We wouldn't want you to get hurt since the boys are a little more
            aggressive... boys will be boys!" <em>(You think:)</em>Boys will be boys? Seriously? How do you respond?</p>
        <p class="story" style="display: none;" id="angryresponse">"Why would you assume that I would get hurt? To be
            honest, I'm probably stronger than a lot of them."</p>
        <p class="story" style="display: none;" id="angryresponse1">"Just because I'm a girl doesn't mean that I
            automatically like yoga..." </p>
        <p class="story" style="display: none;" id="nothingresponse">You don't respond but it's clear that you have a
            disgusted look on your face.</p>
        <p class="story" style="display: none;" id="nothingresponse1">"Are you serious? I've been playing soccer since I
            was five. I'm not going to feel "out of place".</p>

            bad attitude about it!"</p>
        <p class="story" style="display: none;" id="nothingteacherresponse">"Hey, it's not very ladylike to talk back to
            a teacher, missy."</p>
        <p class="story" style="display: none;" id="cspage">As the class progresses, the teacher introduces a new topic
            to the class. "Does anyone know what dictionaries are in Javascript? Can anyone give a brief
            explanation?"</p>
        <p class="story" style="display: none;" id="confidentpage">"A dictionary is a type of list or array that
            consists of a key and a value..." you say, confident in your words. "Wow, you're really smart for a pretty
            girl," says Jackson, the kid sitting next to you. "What is that supposed to mean?" You give him a confused
            look. He replies, "Hey, you should smile! Why can't you just accept the compliment?"</p>
        <p class="story" style="display: none;" id="partyfinish">You and Taylor have just left the concert venue and
            you're getting ready to head back home. She says: "Okay I have to go. Text me when you get home and stay
            safe!!"
            You begin walking in the other direction while you look for a cab, but there don't seem to be any around
            you. <em>(You think:)</em> It's really dark...I wonder what time it is. You go to check your phone but there
            doesn't seem to be any battery left. It must be really late.</p>
        <p class="story" style="display: none;" id="shypage">"Uhh, dictionaries are a thing where they specify data"
            says Jackson, the guy sitting next to you. "That was close, but actually, dictionaries are...", replies the
            teacher. <em>(You think:)</em>a type of list or array that consists of a key and a value... You begin to
            feel annoyed that you didn't answer the question because you could have explained it so much better than
            him. What made you back out from answering?</p>
        <p class="story" style="display: none;" id="csresolve">The bell finally rings and class is over. You couldn't
            wait to get out of there because the only thing on your mind is this concert you're going to after
            school. </p>
        <p class="story" style="display: none;" id="resolve1">The bell finally rings and class is over. You couldn't

        <p class="story" style="display: none;" id="nextchapter">Soon, you are home and back from school. You notice
            that your friend Taylor is calling you about the concert you guys are going to later that night. "Oh. My.
            God. I am sooo excited for tonight!! You better not bail on me to study!!" As you hang up, you relize that
            you don't know how long the concert is going to last. <em>(You think:)</em> I'm probably going to have to
            ask my mom about how late I can stay out. </p>
        <p class="story" style="display: none;" id="convincemom">You go talk to your mom about your curfew. "Hey
            mom...so the concert Taylor and I are going to may end kind of late."</p>
        <p class="story" style="display: none;" id="dangerouscurfew"> "It might be a bit dangerous for you to go out
            when it's dark out," she replies "But why? I'm going with Taylor and I'm sure we'll be safe." "I mean...
            it's not necessarily safe for a girl like you to be out at night. I wouldn't act as stern if you were a boy,
            but you need to be safe!"</p>
        <p class="story" style="display: none;" id="prepareconcert">You're clearly annoyed at what your mom is saying,
            but you're afraid to talk back because it might ruin your chances at going to the concert; and to some
            extent, what your mom is saying is true. "Okay.. I'll make sure I get home at a reasonable time."
            Before long, you hear the doorbell ring and Taylor is at the door. You guys head to the concert
            together.</p>
        <p class="story" style="display: none;" id="catcall">You start walking towards a busier street. While you're
            walking, you notice a group of older guys up ahead. At first you don't seem bothered by them, but as you
            keep walking towards them they begin eyeing you. They start calling out to you. "Hey, how's it going
            beautiful." You begin to pick up the pace and look straight ahead. "Someone just called you beautiful, you
            should smile and say thank you!" They continue to call out to you and you begin panicking. You:</p>
        <p class="story" style="display: none;" id="choosekeys">You reach into your pocket and grab your keys as one of
            the guys begins to approach you. <em>(You think:)</em> Just in case, I guess. You hurry towards the nearest
            drugstore and go inside.They should be gone, right? You tentatively walk back outside where you see a cab.
            You get in and safely go home.</p>
        <p class="story" style="display: none;" id="choosecross"><em>(You think:)</em> Maybe I should cross the street
            to avoid them. You quickly cross over to the other side as you hear their voices fade away. As you continue
            walking, you finally notice a cab, where you get in and you safely go home. </p>
        <p class="story" style="display: none;" id="ending">You have successfully made it through the entire game! Check
            back soon for game updates and new storylines.</p>

        <strong>#Girlyoudontneedmakeup</strong><br/>
        Amy Schumer, actor and comedian, created a parody video revealing how men encourage women to go makeup-free, but judge once they do. Some lyrics include:
        <p>"Girl you don't need makeup, you're perfect when you wake up"..."Hold up, girl we spoke too soon, I didn't
            realize that your lashes were so stubby and pale just a little mascara and you'll look female"..."girl you
            don't need makeup just don't go outside like that, OK?"..."we met someone else, we're out".</p>
        This video has not only shed light on the conflicting messages sold to women by the media but also empowered many women to share their no makeup selfies online, and hopefully this video will encourage you to ignore judgements from society and believe in your OWN confidence!

        <strong>Pretty vs Smart </strong><br/>
        In today's society, more often than not, a girl is expected to choose between being considered pretty or smart. It is from an early age that this kind of a message is instilled in our brains by the media. 
        <blockquote>This article explores this very principle in action. It discusses many people's favorite cartoon
            show, Scooby Doo and its portrayal of Velma as the smart, never sexualized girl, and Daphne, who is almost
            always sexualized but never considered intelligent.
        </blockquote>
        We hope that this example really sheds light on the  media's influence on girls starting very early in childhood.

        <strong>The Punishing Dress Code </strong><br/>
        This post talks about a Labrador school (school in Labrador area) whose dress code unjustly targets girls. Keep in mind this is NOT an isolated incident.
        <blockquote>Dress codes around the country have been coming under fire recently because they disproportionately
            punish female students. The onus is always on the girls to dress appropriately so that they don't distract
            male students, or male teachers.
        </blockquote>
        The article further goes on to elaborate by saying that "Shaming girls for wearing bras or short skirts in hot weather plays very well into a culture that humiliates girls for how they look."

        <strong>Like a girl</strong><br/>
     Stop and think to yourself. Have you ever been told that you do something (run,throw,hit etc) like a girl? Or maybe you haven't, but have you heard someone say that to your sister, or friend? You most likely have. Always campaign, #likeagirl is battling to change the way the phrase "like a girl is used" because 
        <blockquote>Using #LIKEAGIRL as an insult is a hard knock against any adolescent girl. And since the rest of
            puberty's really no picnic either, it's easy to see what a huge impact it can have on a girl's
            self-confidence.
            We[Always] have kicked off an epic battle to make sure that girls everywhere keep their confidence
            throughout puberty and beyond, and making a start by showing them that doing things #LIKEAGIRL is downright
            amazing.

            <strong>The issue with "Boys will be boys"</strong><br/>
         The statement "boys will be boys" is problematic for several reasons. This article discusses why.
            <blockquote>
                <p>1. It prompts students to construct gender stereotypes.</p>
                <p>2. Gender stereotypes allow unconscious biases to form and proliferate.</p>
                <p>3. It is misinformed thinking and oversimplifies the problem.</p>
                <p>4. It limits the full expression of children.</p>

            <strong>Expectation placed on women: you must always look perfect</strong><br/>
            This Australian website speaks to the fact that nowadays, <blockquote>women are expected to constantly be
            attractive. We're expected to be subdued, quiet and well spoken. No one likes a woman who stands up and
            shouts about issues.
        </blockquote>
            <blockquote>As far as feminism has come, it seems that women are still expected to try and be attractive to
                others. From being asked by a man to smile (why do I owe you any sort of facial expression?) to the
                implied expectation that we all wear makeup, shave our bodies and have hair that looks normal.
